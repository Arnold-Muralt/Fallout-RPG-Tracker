## Healing
 * Radiation damage decreases maximum HP until healed (with RadAway, a rad scrubber, or certain food items).
 * Stimpaks heal `25 + Medic skill` HP
 * Radaway heals `25 + Medic skill` Rad points
 * Sleeping in a bed heals all HP up to current maximum HP.  No rad healing.

## Experience
   At level `N`, you need `100 * N` more experience to get to the next one:

    Level     XP
    1         0
    2         100
    3         300
    4         600
    5         1000
    6         1500
    7         2100
       ...

When you level up, you can either: 
 * add `1` point to a S.P.E.C.I.A.L. characteristic (up to a maximum of `10`), or 
 * you can add `10 + Intelligence + Luck` points to skills (up to a maximum of `100` points in a skill).  
 
At each level, you get `5 + Endurance` additional hit points.  Endurance gains do not
retroactively boost hit points, but only increase hit points for that level and subsequent levels.
