# FalloutBattle

Generate the catalog of equipment by running catalog.py; this will
generate catalog.pck, which can be loaded by the `testbattle` and
`multibattle` scripts.

* testbattle runs one battle between various actors
* multibattle runs many trials and reports statistics

TODO: more stuff for the catalog, add options for trials/catalog file
location/quiet/debug/verbose/logger.  (Currently that's all hardcoded.)
