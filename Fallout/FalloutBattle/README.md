# FalloutBattle

Generate the catalog of equipment by running catalog.py; this will
generate catalog.pck (or another file if you use `-c catalogfile`),
which can be loaded by the `testbattle` and `multibattle` scripts.

* testbattle runs one battle between various actors
* multibattle runs many trials and reports statistics

TODO: more stuff for the catalog.
