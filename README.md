## [Fallout](https://github.com/athornton/rpgexperiments/tree/master/Fallout)

Fallout pen-and-paper RPG.

### Fallout/[FalloutArmor](https://github.com/athornton/rpgexperiments/tree/master/Fallout/FalloutArmor)

Working on a damage-reduction armor system for my homebrew Fallout
system.  It's a class (FalloutArmor.py) and a little harness
(fallout-armor.py).  It requires Python 3.4 (for the statistics module)
and you need matplotlib to get the graphs (but it will run without it).

### Fallout/[FalloutSimulator](https://github.com/athornton/rpgexperiments/tree/master/Fallout/FalloutSimulator)

Early days of a more general Fallout combat simulator.  So far,
one-on-one combat between combatants who use only weapons that do
physical damage and don't do any splash damage seems to work.

Here is a simple [battle test script](https://github.com/athornton/rpgexperiments/tree/master/Fallout/testbattle.py)
