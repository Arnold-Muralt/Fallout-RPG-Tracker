## Fallout

Fallout pen-and-paper RPG.

### Fallout/FalloutArmor

Working on a damage-reduction armor system for my homebrew Fallout
system.  It's a class (FalloutArmor.py) and a little harness
(fallout-armor.py).  It requires Python 3.4 (for the statistics module)
and you need matplotlib to get the graphs (but it will run without it).
